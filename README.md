Part 1: ECSimTask and ECSimTaskScheduler were given as template code. 
In ECSimTask2 and ECSimTaskScheduler2 is my code, which implements new task types and scheduler types through an inheritance hierarchy. 
These tasks and schedulers are tested in ECSimTaskTests.

Part2: ECSimTaskScheduler3 as well as the ECSimTask and ECSimIntervalTask classes are template code.
The decorators for ECSimTask objects in ECSimTask3 were created by me.
These decorators are tested in ECSimTaskTests3.
